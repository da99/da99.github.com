"I watched excellent engineers waste away at Google because they didn't have the political skills to avoid having their progress blocked, and watched as really poor engineers benefited out of proportion to the circumstance rather than skill."

"Might the Pentagon be worried that our own troops could learn from the Taliban? Were I an American soldier who had been told to hand over or unload his weapon before approaching Secretary Panetta, I would certainly have read it that way."

In the academic research fields: <br />
"Because Dawson had not been actively publishing in recent years, 
he no longer knew all of the rhetorical tricks, newfangled buzzwords, 
and marketing-related contortions required to satisfy reviewers and get 
his papers accepted into top-tier conferences. Also, the more furiously 
his competitors published, the more strict the reviewers became about 
demanding for him and his students to justify the originality of their 
ideas in relation to the piles of related work, and the more frustrating 
the paper rejections became. "

"However, the unspoken shame in modern science is that it's nearly impossible to reproduce or verify any of those findings, since the original computer code and data sets used to produce those findings are rarely available. As a result, lots of papers containing egregious errors—due to both honest mistakes and outright fraud—have gone unchallenged, sometimes resulting in scientific claims that have led to human deaths."

There are geniuses in academia:
"Research into software development tools for non-software engineers, but rather for scientists, engineers, and researchers who need to program for their jobs -- they're not gonna care about specs., model checking, etc. -- they just want pragmatic, lightweight, and conceptually-simple tools that they can pick up quickly and use all the time.
