* chef-solo
* capistrano
* [Chef-Solo-Nodes](https://github.com/da99/Chef_Solo_Nodes)
* [Bootstrap for RBENV and Chef-Solo](https://github.com/da99/boot_ups/tree/master/straps)

I avoid use of [knife-solo](https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo)
and instead use Capistrano.  In the future, I would most likely use
Chef-Solo and related tools instead of Capistrano.  Until then,
it is easier to use Capistrano to send commands to Chef nodes.

I use Capistrano to execute a shell script (bootstrap) that installs
RBENV and Chef-Solo.  Then I can send other commands to run the
Chef recipes.

In order to share data between servers, I commit the data to 
a git repo and do a "git push". I use a private repo on 
BitBucket because they offer free private repos.  You do not have to 
do this if you use Chef Server.
