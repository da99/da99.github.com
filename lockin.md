Lockin is not as important in the 21st Century.  Al the 70+ year old people
are dying off. They are replaced by people much more comfortable 
with setting up a computer. Also, switching to a different website 
is easier than switching to another operating system.

If you can't compete, it's because you lack fundamental understanding
of your customers. Your competitors may succeed through luck or knowledge.
